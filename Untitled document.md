## **Exploration of Gun violence in the US** 

**Motivation: **

Gun violence in US causes many deaths. We would like to analyze the Gun violence dataset to explore location related trends and other characteristics such as firearm regulations and how they are being amended. We would also like to use the firearms provision dataset to see if there is any correlation between the increase in firearms license to the gun violence incidents.We would also like to use this data to find if there is any correlation to increase in rent to those areas using the Zillow dataset.
